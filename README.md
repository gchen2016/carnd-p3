# carnd-p3 (In Progress ...)
Training an testing the driving in simulator.

## Overview
 1. Fisrt generate the data using simulator.
 2. Build a CNN to calssify driving.
 3. Test the model in the simulator.
 
## File Structure
 * model.py - The script to create and train the model.
 * drive.py - The script to drive the car.
 * model.json - The model architecture.
 * model.h5 - The model weights.
 * READM.md - This file.

## Run Server
 * python drive.py model.json

## Structure of CNN
The structure is based of the CNN architecture in Nvidia's End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars parper (http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf)



## Training Approach
Using the Nvidia's CNN architecture to train the data saved in training mode from the simulator. The data have xx images.

Then...
